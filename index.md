## INTERNAL NOTE TO BE REMOVED BEFORE FINAL DEPLOYMENT
- GOAL
    - single location to provide relevant, brief information that answers FAQ that new implementation teams have had. 
- Graphics:
    - **simple**, max of 3 colors. 
    - Easily digestible in a short glance. 
    - use only what is needed to provide context or improve site readability. 
- Text: 
    - Use H2 for ToC generation on all major parts. 
    - Do not attempt to explain any concepts in depth. The goal is to develop a LIGHTWEIGHT website for teams to refer to with the minimum amount of information needed to complete forms/tasks. If they want to know more, they can reach out to the SNWG MO team for further context/direction. 
    - Footnotes to links to further reading can be created[^10] 
    - do not embed slidedecks. Extract relevant information and HIGH POINTS to this site and utilize footnotes.[^11]

## What do we produce?

The SNWG MO helps various agencies produce **EOSDIS Standard Products**[^1]
+
EOS Standard Products are internally consistent, well-calibrated records of observations of the Earth's geophysical properties. They are identified and defined by EOS investigators who have been selected through a competitive peer review process to develop algorithms and software for generating products from EOS observations.
- _Products_ contain geophysical parameters and can be used for science research and application.
- _Standard_ products are validated, QA and fully documented.
- A _standard product file_ may require companion/support files to make data usable or to satisfy policy requirements. Examples include geolocation data files, browse image data, calibration and validation, higher-resolution data undergoing validation, and data quality metrics.
