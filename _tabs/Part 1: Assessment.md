_The initial SNWG Project Assessment lifecycle._

****This section needs careful review. What information can be public?****

### Need Identification
Surveys are sent out the agencies to identify their satellite needs

### Need Evaluation
Surveys are reviewed and interviews held with the submitting agencies to clarify what's in their survey response (drill down to what they specifically need)

### Solution Identification
Based on all of the needs that were submitted, potential solutions that would meet multiple of these needs are identified

### Solution Development
For the solutions identified, a rough outline of the product/activity is developed

### Solution Selection
The proposed solutions are presented to US Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to be selected for funding. OMB selects the Solutions to fund, then appoints the Implementation teams to form the Project that will develop the Product that will provide the Solution to fulfill the Need. 

## Co-design/Co-production in the Assessment Phase
Ya'll need to be talking to us or don't complain when the Product doesn't do what you want.
