_The initial SNWG Project Assessment lifecycle._

****This section needs careful review. What information can be public?****

### Need Identification
We send out a survey to figure out what ya'll think you need

### Need Evaluation
We read all those surveys and have interviews with everybody to drill down to what you actually need.

### Solution Identification
We pick the needs that appear to have the most commonality and general societal benefit.

### Solution Development
We develop a rough idea of the Product that can be created to provide a Solution to a Need. 

### Solution Selection
We present those Solutions to the US Office of Management and Budget (OMB). OMB chooses the Solutions to fund and appoints the Implementation teams to form the Project that will develop the Product that will provide the Solution to fulfill the Need. 

## Co-design/Co-production in the Assessment Phase
Ya'll need to be talking to us or don't complain when the Product doesn't do what you want.
