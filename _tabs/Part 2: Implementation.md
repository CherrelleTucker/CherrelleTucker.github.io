## The SNWG MO Program Plan[]
The SNWG MO Program Plan should have been shared with you as a part of your "Welcome to the SNWG" package. The purpose of this document is to provide a framework and governance and framework to the operations of the Management Office throughout the Program and Project lifecycles.

### Why you care <br>
While the SNWG MO Program Plan governs the process and actions of the SNWG MO as a whole, several portions flow down to directly influence the Projects that the MO oversees. The entire document may not need to be read to understand the Office and the process. However, there are several key parts that directly influence the funding and ultimate success of your project. 

### What parts matter to you? 
Key parts of the SNWG MO Program Plan for the purposes of the Project Implementation Teams are:
- 5.1.2 Requirements on the SNWG Solution Projects
- 6.2 Solution Project Implementation Collaborations
- 6.3 SNWG MO SEP Collaborations
- 12.2 Solution Project Lifecycle
