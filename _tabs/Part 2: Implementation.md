* Project Closeout
* Solution Operations Handoff or Defunding (MO action)
* Solution Closeout (MO action)

## The SNWG MO Program Plan

The SNWG MO Program Plan should have been shared with you as a part of your "Welcome to the SNWG" package. The purpose of this document is to provide a framework and governance to the operations of the Management Office throughout the Program and Project lifecycles. You may also click here for a [direct link to the SNWG MO Program Plan pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xe-rrKjwZZ7p0w39umL7nPdjCXmWwkUW/view?usp=sharing)

### Why you care

While the SNWG MO Program Plan governs the overall process and actions of the SNWG MO, not all sections are relevant to our Projects. However, several key portions do directly impact the Projects overseen by the MO. It may not be necessary to read the entire document to understand the Office and its processes, but understanding these crucial parts is essential for the funding and ultimate success of your project.

### What parts matter to you?

Key parts of the SNWG MO Program Plan for the purposes of the Project Implementation Teams are:

* 5.1.2 Requirements on the SNWG Solution Projects
* 6.2 Solution Project Implementation Collaborations
* 6.3 SNWG MO SEP Collaborations
* 12.2 Solution Project Lifecycle

## Decision Gates

### What are they and why do we have them?

Each decision gate ensures that the project has properly investigated and developed the development, budgeting, and documentation appraoch required to move to the next phase in the project lifecycle for maximum return of value to both the funding sources of the project and the end user of Solution Product.

### Authority to Proceed

The Authority to Proceed Decision Gate (AtP DG) is a focused review of the inital project documentation to determine the solution project’s readiness to proceed from Pre-Formulation to Formulation and document the decision. (SNWG MO Program Plan 12.2.1.6)

*The pre-formulation phase of a solution project starts after NASA learns about proposed SNWG activities in OMB’s funding request. Projects begin at this stage, but budget and scope adjustments can still be made until NASA receives and distributes funds (at the start of the fiscal year) and the project enters the formulation phase. Initiating solution projects at this stage allows pre-formulation activities to be carried out so that funds can be distributed to solution projects as soon as possible.*

* What you need to do before the ATP DG:
    * Complete your preliminary Project Plan, which includes:
        * [x] Notional OSS Objectives (How will your project adhere to Open Source Science principles during Solution Product development and operation?)
        * [x] Notional SEP Plan (How will your project promote stakeholder engagemenet throughout the Solution Product development and operation?)
        * [x] Outline your management approach (Team structure, partnerships, acquisition strategy, Milestone reviews Tip: Refer to team members by their ROLE thoughout the plan. Define the names associated with the role in a chart in supporting sections.)
        * [x] Notional schedule (Tip: Use ranges and relative times, not exact dates i.e. "2 months after project signing" "2 years after project Implementation start" Do keep in mind the limitations of final funding dates.)
        * [x] Resource requirements
            * Project L1
            * PLR Compliance matrix
        * [x] Solution Product Transition or Dissemination approach (Firm handoff plans are not required. Do include preliminary suppositions and potential handoff agencies or partners to be investigated throughout the Project lifecycle and borne to fruition by Project Closeout.)
        * [x] Risk Management Strategy
        * [x] Applicable Control Plans
            * Required:
                * Notional Open Source Data Management Plan (OSDMP)
            * As needed and customized for the scope of the Project:
                * CM Plan (internal note: what is CM?)
                * System Security Plan
                * Risk Development Plan
        * [x] Notice to the SNWG MO of any external funding sources necessary for project success
<br>
* What you need to do during
    * [x] The Project Implementation Team presents the goals and status of their project \~15 - 20 mintues
    * [x] The SNWG MO leads a walkthrough of the Implementation-prepared preliminary Project Plan. Your team will address any questions and make note of actions to be taken to address any concerns about the Project Plan.
<br>
* What you need to do after
    * [x] Complete any outstanding action identified as blockers to signing the ATP DG Memorandum.
<br>
* Ultimate result: The Solution Project is authorized to proceed to the Project Formulation stage where the finer details of developing the Solution Product will be documented, the contractual agreement between NASA and the contracting Project organization is foramlized.

### Formulation to Implementation

*After a successful ATP DG review and the establishment of a contract between the SNWG MO and the solution project, the formulation phase begins. This phase involves detailed planning for the implementation phase, including developing project control plans, finalizing the Project Plan, and establishing necessary agreements. Note that sometimes the formulation phase is brief, lasting just long enough to prepare for the Formulation to Implementation Decision Gate (DG).*

* What you need to do during
* What you need to do after

### Implementation to Operations

*After a successful Formulation to Implementation DG review, the project enters the implementation phase. Here, the planned activities are carried out as described in the Project Plan, following the scheduled costs and timelines. Periodic reviews and milestone assessments are conducted as outlined in the Project Plan. The implementation phase concludes either by moving into the operational phase or, for projects without an operational phase, by completing closeout activities like archiving data/information and undergoing a Project Closeout DG review.*

## Co-design/Co-production in the Implementation Phase

* what is expected of the Stakeholders

## Open Source Science (OSS) in the Implementation Phase

> The Satellite Needs Working Group Management Office strongly encourages all SNWG Implementation team members take the time to enroll in and complete [NASA's Transform to Open Science (TOPS) OSS 101 course](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/).
