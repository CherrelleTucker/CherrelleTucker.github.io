Federal agency participation in the SNWG survey is on the rise: the number of submitted surveys increased 50% in the 2020 cycle and remained elevated in the 2022 cycle. NASA established a SNWG Management Office within NASA's Interagency Implementation and Advanced Concepts Team (IMPACT) at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, AL, to manage the process of assessing agency needs for satellite Earth observations and, importantly, the implementation and operations of solutions developed by NASA to meet these needs. The SNWG Management Office is an integral part of NASAâ€™s response to the needs of other federal agencies through its SNWG Stakeholder Engagement Program (SEP).
