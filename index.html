Welcome to the Satellite Needs Working Group Management Office site for Project Implementation Teams!
<br>
This site is intended to serve as a guide for Implementation teams through the SNWG MO lifecycle. 
The focus is on providing information to assist the Implementation team in completing their expected actions, 
without overburdening with in-depth knowledge that may not be necessary to completing tasks.
